# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 3.1.1 - Python - Comparing MakeCode to Python - Activity

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged
**Comparing blocks to text - Activity**

In this activity we will explore the Python interface in Code Builder and compare various MakeCode blocks to Python code.

**Read through the whole tutorial and then try to perform the actions**

You can download a copy of this activity by returing to the game and clicking the Download Activity button on the Non Player Character.

## Step 2 @unplugged
In the Minecraft world open Code Builder by pressing the C key on the keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on screen.

## Step 3 @unplugged
Click on the New Project icon to create a new MakeCode project

When prompted set the project name to Lesson 3 Activity 1.

## Step 4 @unplugged
The default block-based coding editor with the default on chat command "run" block and on start block will appear.
 
Change the event handler to respond to the command sayHello by changing the text run to sayHello

## Step 5 @unplugged
Click on the Convert code to Python button (you may need to click on the down arrow to chage from JavaScript to Python) to display the code in Python.

## Step 6 @unplugged
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/4.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

Notice there are 3 lines of code.

The first line of code starts with def on_chat - this is creating a function called on_chat.

The 2nd line of code is indented - this means that the line of code is part of the function on_chat. The line of code pass does nothing - **pass** is like a placeholder which you replace with code later.

The 3rd line of code is setting the function on_chat as an event handler for the event on_chat of the player when the chat words are sayHello.

The first part within the brackets specifies the chat command to respond to and the second command specifies which function to run when that chat command is entered.

## Step 7 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button. 

Add a ``||player: say ":)" ||`` block from the ``||player: Player ||`` drawer into the event handler.

## Step 8 @unplugged
Change back to the Python view.

Notice that the code pass has been replaced on line 2 with another line of code - this is the equivalent of the ``||player: say ":)" ||`` block.

Again as this block came from the ``||player: Player||`` drawer the code starts with the word player.

We want to make the player perform an action (say a word) so we call a function of the player called say.

The say function takes a parameter (what to say) - this is the portion inside the brackets and as what we want to say is text it is enclosed in double quotes (" ").

## Step 9 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button.

Add a ``||player: teleport to ~0 ~0 ~0 ||`` block from the ``||player: Player||`` drawer into the event handler and change the Y coordinate to 10

## Step 10 @unplugged
Change back to the Python view.

Notice that a single line of code has been added at line 3 - this is the equivalent of the ``||player: teleport to ~0 ~0 ~0 ||`` block.

Again the teleport block came from the player drawer so the code starts with the word player and we want the player to be teleported therefore the teleport function is called.

This function takes a parameter - where to be teleported to. This parameter is a coordinate.

## Step 11 @unplugged
Whilst in Python view you can choose to either enter text into the editor window or drag blocks of Python from the drawers like you did with MakeCode blocks

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/9.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

## Step 12 @unplugged
Add a new empty line to your code after line 

``` player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0)) ```

by placing your cursor at the end of that line and pressing the Enter key.

## Step 13 @unplugged
Press the tab key on your keyboard to indent the line of code (to add it to the function) and enter the Python code 

``` player.say("This is my first line of Python!")```

on the new line.

## Step 14 @unplugged
Switch back to the MakeCode block view and notice there is now a ``||player: say "This is my first line of Python!" ||`` block.

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/12.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

Switch back to Python.

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.1.1/images/11.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

## Step 15 @unplugged
Create another empty line after the code 
``` player.say("This is my first line of Python!") ```
you just entered.

Open the ``||player: Player ||`` drawer and notice there are a number of blocks just like in MakeCode blocks view.

Find the block ``||player: say ":)" ||`` and drag it out and place it on the recently created empty line in your code.

You should notice the code

```player.say(":)") ```

has been added.

It can be tricky to position the Python block easily so its best to just type Python text into the editor.

## Step 16 @tutorialCompleted
Click on the Exit Tutorial button at the top of the screen to return to the main Code Builder window and create a new project to try the activity.

Once you have completed the activity move onto the next Non Player Character.
