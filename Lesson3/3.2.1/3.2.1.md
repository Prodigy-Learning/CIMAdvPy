## Step 1 @unplugged
**Changing the value of parameters in Python - Activity**

We have already started to see how Python code compares to block-based coding.

Previously we have looked at how Python code compares to block-based coding but we haven't changed any of the Python. 

We will now start to make changes to Python to and see how this affects our Minecraft world.

You can download a copy of this activity by returing to the game and clicking the Download Activity button on the Non Player Character.

## Step 2 @unplugged
We will create a sample program with some simple blocks as detailed below to learn more.

The below sample program in Python is the equivalent of the below in MakeCode blocks

**Python**
```python
def on_chat():
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.teleport_to_player()
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
player.on_chat("sayHello", on_chat)
```

The code appears in the editor with line numbers as below:

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 3
The code has been entered into the Python editor for you below.

Notice that the 5 lines of code inside the event handler all call on functions of the player or agent and 4 of these take parameters (the only one not taking a parameter being the agent.teleportToPlayer()).

```template
player.onChat("sayHello", function on_chat() {
    player.say("Hi!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 4
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

You should have noticed that a message saying hi appears, your agent appears and turns right and moves one block forward and you then teleport to 10 blocks above your current position.

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7
Change the parameter being passed to the player.say function to "Hello player!" (note: keep the double quotes as this is a string variable).

## Step 8
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice that a chat message reflecting the change you made in Python is now displayed (Hello Player!).

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 10
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 11 @tutorialCompleted
Once complete move onto the second part of the activity.
