# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 4.1 - Python - Repeat Loops

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops**

Repeat loops will repeat a series of code statements a specified number of times.

The repeat loop in Python is also known as the For loop.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops**

The Repeat loop in MakeCode block-based coding is the equivalent of the Python For loop.

The For loop is made up of 1 line of code which ends in a colon (:) and all the lines of code you want to repeat in the loop indented under it.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("turn", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 1)
        agent.place(SixDirection.Back)
    }
})
```

This example shows the for loop in its basic state with only a `pass` line of code within it (line 3) which remember means do nothing and continue. Notice the word pass is indented.

You can either type the code in or drag out a Python ``||LOOPS: for ||`` block from the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS ||`` drawer.

Line 2 contains the main functionality of the for loop and can be broken down into two sections:

The word `for` indicates this line of code is a for loop and the next word (`index`) is the loop control variable.

The `in range(4)` specifies how many times the loop will enumerate. In this case 4 times.

The first time the loop runs the value of index is 0.

Each time the loop enumerates the value of index is increased by 1.


## Step 4 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops - Example**

**Python**
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.1/images/3.jpg?raw=true "Python")

In this example we have added one line of code into the loop.

This line of code will move the agent forward by 1 block each time it is run.

The first time the loop is run the loop control variable (Index) is set to the value 0.

The line(s) of code within the loop will run one after the other and when the end of the lines of code within the loop is reached the loop control variable (index) is increased by 1 and the end condition is evaluated again. Now the value of index is 1 therefore the contents of the loop will run again as 1 is less than 8.

This process is repeated a further 7 times to complete 8 loop enumerations.
