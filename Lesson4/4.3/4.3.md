# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 4.3 - Python - For loops in Python

## Step 1 @unplugged
**For loops in Python**

For loops will repeat a series of code statements a specified number of times.

We have already looked at for loops when we looked at repeat loops which in Python are for loops.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**For loops in Python**

The for loop is made up of 2 lines of code with all the lines of code you want to repeat in the loop contained between them.

This example shows the for loop in its basic state with no lines of code within it to repeat.

Line 2 contains the main functionality of the for loop and can be broken down into two sections:

The word for indicates this line of code is a for loop and the text in range(4) indicates to repeat this 4 times.

Line 3 contains the default contents of pass which means do nothing and just continue - we will replace this with the code we want to repeat.

In this example we have added one line of code into the loop.

This line of code will move the agent forward by 1 block each time it is run.

The first time the loop is run the loop control variable (Index) is set to the value 0, the end condition is then evaluated (index <= 8) and in this case evaluates to true (as 0 is less than or equal to 8) therefore the loop will run.

The line(s) of code within the loop will run one after the other and when the end of the lines of code within the loop is reached the loop control variable (index) is increased by 1 and the end condition is evaluated again. Now the value of index is 1 therefore the contents of the loop will run again as 1 is less than 8.

This process is repeated a further 6 times whilst the value of index is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Upon the loop completing when the value of index is 7 the value of index is increased to 8. This time when the end condition is evaluated it returns true (as 8 is less than or equal to 8) and the contents of the loop will run.

Once all the code in the loop has run when the value of index is 8 the value of index is increased to 9 and the end condition is evaluated. This time the end condition is evaluated to false as 9 is not less than or equal to 8. This ends the running of the loop and any code after the loop will now run.
