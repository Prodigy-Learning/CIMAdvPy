## Step 1 @unplugged
**Algorithms** are a set of steps to follow to solve a problem or perform a task.

They are commonly used before writing computer code to define the steps needed to solve the particular problem.

Algorithms are written in plain English, not a programming language.

The first algorithms date back to 1600 BC when they were used to solve mathematical problems.

There may be more than one method to solve a problem or perform a task.

In such cases writing out the different methods as algorithms may enable you to decide on which method is the best.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm**

Algorithms are a set of steps written in plain English and there are no set rules on how to write them - they should be clear, correct and readable and understandable by others.

Writing algorithms in this way can sometimes be referred to as pseudocode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Adding 2 numbers**

Below is an example of an algorithm to add 2 numbers together. This algorithm should work for any 2 numbers and should be able to be understood by others with no explanation.

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Create variables number1, number2 and result

Step 3) Ask user for number1

Step 4) Read input and store in number1 variable

Step 5) Ask user for number2

Step 6) Read input and store in number2 variable

Step 7) Add number1 and number2 and store result in result variable

Step 8) Display result variable

Step 9) Stop

Run through the algorithm a few times with various different numbers to test that it works.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Sorting numbers**

Sorting numbers can become quite complex and time consuming. This is a task which can be performed by a computer quite easily and a lot quicker than we can.

One method of sorting is called the 'bubble sort' - this is an algorithm which will sort any number of numbers into the correct order.

The steps for a bubble sort are:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Read first number from the list

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list

Step 7) If any numbers were swapped repeat from step 2

Step 8) If the end of the list is reached without making any swaps the list is in order

Step 9) Stop

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Sorting numbers**

To test the sorting algorithm lets try it with the below list of 3 numbers:

3, 1, 2

This would result in the algorithm running as below:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Read first number from the list 
        - 3

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list 
        - 1

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap 
        - Yes it is smaller so swap resulting in the list currently being 1, 3, 2

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number 
        - 3

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list 
        - 2

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap 
        - Yes it is smaller so swap resulting in the list currently being 1, 2, 3

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number 
        - 3

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list - Last number reached 
        - proceed to Step 7

Step 7) If any numbers were swapped repeat from step 2

Step 2) Read first number from the list 
        - 1

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list 
        - 2

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap 
        - No it is not smaller so no swap - list is still 1, 2, 3

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number 
        - 2

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list 
        - 3

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap 
        - No it is not smaller so no swap 
        - List is still 1, 2, 3

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number 
        - 3

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list 
        - Last number reached 
        - Proceed to Step 7

Step 7) If any numbers were swapped repeat from  step 2 
        - No swaps so proceed to step 8

Step 8) If the end of the list is reached without making any swaps the list is in order 
        - End of list so proceed to step 9

Step 9) Stop

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Sorting numbers**

Can you work out what the list would look like as the steps in the algorithm were processed for the below 5 number list?

4, 2, 3, 1, 5

Give it a try and compare your steps with the solution on the next step.

The algorithm for a bubble sort is repeated below:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Read first number from the list

Step 3) Compare this number with the next number in the list

Step 4) If the next number is smaller than the current number then swap the 2 numbers, if the next number is greater than the current number do not swap

Step 5) Read the next number in the list and make this the current number

Step 6) Repeat from step 3 until the last number in the list

Step 7) If any numbers were swapped repeat from step 2

Step 8) If the end of the list is reached without making any swaps the list is in order

Step 9) Stop

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Sorting numbers**

Can you work out what the list would look like as the steps in the algorithm were processed for the below 5 number list?

4, 2, 3, 1, 5

The list would look like the below through the process:

- The first time the loop of steps 2-6 runs the list would be processed as below:

        -- 4, 2, 3, 1, 5 (4 and 2 compared and swapped as 2 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 4, 3, 1, 5 (4 and 3 compared and swapped as 3 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 (4 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 2)

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (3 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 3)

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 3 is greater than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (1 and 2 compared and not swapped as 2 is greater than 1)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 3 is greater than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were no values swapped we can continue to step 8 and end as the list is now in order
