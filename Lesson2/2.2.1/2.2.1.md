# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 2.2.1 - Algorithms - Go to the park Algorithm

### @explicitHints true
### @hideIteration true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will write an algorithm to describe the process you perform when you want to go to the park

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Thinking about the process**

Spend a few moments to think about what you do when you are about to go to the park - put on your shoes, put on a jacket etc

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Now you have thought about what things you do in the morning lets create an algorithm to describe the process.

Using pen and paper write your algorithm down.

When you have completed your algorithm continue to the next step.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Your algorithm should resemble something like the following:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Put on your shoes

Step 3) If its wet or cold then put on a jacket

Step 4) Open front door

Step 5) Leave house with parent/guardian

Step 6) Close front door

Step 7) Lock front door

Step 8) If the park is far away then drive, otherwise walk to park

Step 9) Stop

You may not take the exact same steps or in the same order (e.g. you may put your jacket on before your shoes) but your algorithm should be able to be understood by others and describe the process.
