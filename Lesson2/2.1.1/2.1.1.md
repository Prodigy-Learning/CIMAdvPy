# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 2.1.1 - Algorithms - Morning Routine Algorithm
### @explicitHints true
### @hideIteration true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will write an algorithm to describe the process you perform on a school morning

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Thinking about the process**

Spend a few moments to think about what you do in the morning when you wake up - brush your teeth, eat breakfast, pack your bag, get dressed etc...

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Now you have thought about what things you do in the morning lets create an algorithm to describe the process.

Using pen and paper write your algorithm down.

When you have completed your algorithm continue to the next step.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Your algorithm should resemble something like the following:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Get out of bed

Step 3) Shower or get washed

Step 4) Get dressed

Step 5) Eat breakfast

Step 6) Brush teeth

Step 7) Pack school bag

Step 8) Go to school

Step 9) Stop

You may not take the exact same steps or in the same order (e.g. you may eat breakfast before you get dressed) but your algorithm should be able to be understood by others and describe the process.
